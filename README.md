## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Amanda! _(she/her)_
I'm a web developer and designer based in the New York Metropolitan Area.
I spent five years studying computer science and design at Northeastern University in Boston, and I thrive in positions that incorporate skills from both of my disciplines.

My favorite thing that design and code have in common is the creative processâ€”I love seeing how the decisions made each step of the way come together to support the final product.

When it comes to my work, I enjoy improving any type of user experience, but Iâ€™m most passionate about sharing and preserving culture and uplifting marginalized voices, especially through storytelling.
